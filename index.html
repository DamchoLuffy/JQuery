      While creating a comic book empire, Robert Kirkman mastered the art of
      writing long. <br />
      sagas rarely wrap up quickly. In 2003, he began crafting the series that
      would take him on a path straight to Hollywood: “The Walking Dead,” a
      zombie apocalyptic adventure that ran for 193 issues, published its final
      issue in 2019, after it had become a television phenomenon at AMC.<br />.
      Kirkman’s “Invincible” also began in 2003 and had a similar
      decade-and-a-half run, printing a final 144th issue in 2018. Those comics
      are the inspiration for Kirkman’s big debut in the world of animation.<br />
      “Invincible,” a family saga that begins with a teenage protagonist named
      Mark Grayson becoming a superhero just like his father, began streaming on
      Amazon Prime Video in March. The season’s final episode debuted Friday,
      with many more cliffhangers yet to come after Amazon announced
      “Invincible” has been renewed for a second and third season.

        WHAT IS 3D PRINTING?
        <br />
        3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is defined as a
        process in which a digital file is used to create a three-dimensional
        solid object. In the 3D printing process, sequential layers of material
        are laid down by the ‘printer’ until object creation is completed. This
        article covers the working, software, and applications of 3D printing.

          The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat
          Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are an infamous and powerful pirate
          crew that originated from the East Blue. They are the main focus and
          protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main
          protagonist Monkey D. Luffy.<br />
          <br />
          The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given
          to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw
          Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom.<sup>[21]</sup> The crew
          sailed on the Going Merry,[22] their first official Straw Hat ship, up
          until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and
          Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by
          Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.<sup
            >[23]</sup
          ><br />
          <br />
          Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were
          separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the
          Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years,
          they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for
          the sake of helping each other.<sup>[24]</sup> They then reunited and
          have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly
          disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers, which would
          eventually lead to their captain being recognized as one of the Four
          Emperors.<sup>[25]</sup>

          The crew currently consists of ten members, being smaller than a
          typical pirate crew; when he first set sail, Luffy set a goal of
          gaining ten crewmates. They have one former member, Nefertari Vivi,
          who sailed with the crew from Reverse Mountain to the Arabasta
          Kingdom. <br />
          <br />Despite their small size, the Straw Hats are an extremely
          diverse group possessing a large variety of backgrounds. Their
          members' origins range from ordinary islanders and workers to bounty
          hunters, royalty, criminal gang members, and veteran pirates; Jinbe
          was once part of the renowned Seven Warlords of the Sea while Robin
          was an active enemy of the crew at one point with Baroque Works. The
          crew consists of eight humans, one fish-man, and one animal with Devil
          Fruit-powered human intellect; of the humans, Sanji possesses
          superhuman modifications given to him at birth, Franky is a cyborg,
          and Brook possesses a skeleton body after being resurrected by a Devil
          Fruit power. They range in age from 17 (Chopper) to 90 (Brook); the
          median age of the crew is 21.

        <u> <b>Sub-Groups</b></u> <br />During their adventures, the crew
        members have often split into smaller groups to achieve multiple targets
        or tasks. Mostly, the group are divided by the common tasks of island
        exploring (often led by Luffy), ship guarding (often led by Zoro who
        wishes to nap or by Usopp who is afraid to disembark), and supply
        gathering (led by Sanji or Nami for food and finance). When encountering
        enemies, the crew would often fight individually against their rivals,
        but they sometimes fight in small groups like Usopp and Chopper in
        Arabasta or during the Davy Back fight.

        indicate that the identity of the noun is known to the reader. The
        indefinite article (a, an) is used before a noun that is general or when
        its identity is not known. There are certain situations in which a noun
